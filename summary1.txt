Javascript summary
1).Hello World.
javascript is a programming language that can be used in any browser 

it runs on the side of the web ,,where it is used to design /program how the web pages behave on  the occurence of an event

2).variables and types

var-this is used to declare a variable hence intializing it  to a value

example;var a =2(2 being the value)
there are different types of variables

a)Boolean variables can only be equal to either true or false

b)var array we use square brackets
c)var objects we use calibraces

undefined means declaring a variable without defining its value

example;
var a;
null
null -its used when a variable should be marked as empty
example

var a = null;
example of an object;

var user ={firstName:"purity",lastName:"mbugua"};

example of an array;

var fruit = ["mangoes","oranges","bananas","kiwi"];


3).Arrays-
defining arrays we use brackets notation or the array object notation

example;
var fruit = ["mangoes","kiwi"];
var fruit = new myFruit("mangoes",kiwi");

Addressing:
we can use the brackets operators [] to address a specific cell

example;

console.log(myFruit[1]);

Array Elements:

example;
var myList = ["mangoes",10,{}];
Manipulating Arrays
push-we use it to insert a variable

pop - we use it to remove a variable

example;

var fruit = [];

fruit.push("mangoes");

fruit.push("kiwi");

fruit.push("Banana");

console.log(fruit);

VM71:5 (3) ["mangoes", "kiwi", "Banana"]
shifting and unshifting are used from the beginning of an array

splicing this is used to remove a certain part of an array to create a new array


4).0perators
The addition operator is used for both addition and concatenation of strings

examples;
var a = 8;

var b = 7;

var c =a+b;


c

15
var name = "purity"

console.log("Hello"+"" +name);

VM151:2 Hellopurity
we also have different mathematical operators

subtract(-)

divide(/,//)

multiply(*)


we can also use advanced mathematical operators such as;
modulus(%)


5).Coditions
The if statement-
it is used to check  if an expression is true or false

var time = new Date().getHours();

if (time < 20) {

 greeting = "Good day";

}else {

 greeting = "Good evening";

}

"Good day"



The switch statement -
used to select between more then two different options and run the same code for more than one option


example;
switch (new Date().getDay()) {

 case 0:

day = "Sunday";

   break;

 case 1:
 
  day = "Monday";

   break;

 case 2:

    day = "Tuesday";

   break;
 
case 3:
 
  day = "Wednesday";

   break;

 case 4:
 
  day = "Thursday";

   break;

 case 5:

   day = "Friday";

   break;

 case 6:

   day = "Saturday";
}

"Sunday"


6).Loops-
The for loop 
it is mainly used for rating over arrays and objects

example;
var m;

for (m = 0; m < 3; m = m + 1)

{

   console.log(m);

}
VM261:4 0

VM261:4 1

VM261:4 2




The while statement
used to check if  an expression evaluates  or runs as long as it is true

example;

var i = 5;

while (i > 0)

{

   console.log(i + " JavaScript books on the table");

   i -= 1;
}

5 JavaScript books on the table

4 JavaScript books on the table

3 JavaScript books on the table

2 JavaScript books on the table

1 JavaScript books on the table



7).break and continuous statements
 
break statement allows to stop the execution of the loop

the continuous statement skips the rest of the loop and jumps back to the beginning of the loop


for (var n = 0; n < 10; n++)

{

 
  if (n % 2 == 0)

   {
 
       continue;

   }

 
  console.log(n + " is an odd number.");

}
1 is an odd number.

3is an odd number.

5 is an odd number.

7 is an odd number.

9 is an odd number.
